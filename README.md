# SchoolExams-Project
XYZ School is a modern and innovative educational institution that offers both technical and scientific programs to students of all ages. Our technical program, known as "Tecnico," provides students with the skills and knowledge necessary to excel in fields such as engineering, technology, and applied sciences. Our scientific program, known as "Scientifico," offers a comprehensive education in traditional academic subjects such as mathematics, science, and literature.

- About this project: 

  - > My project is a web application designed for teachers to manage exams and schedules for students. The website features a login and registration system for teachers to access the exam management features.

  - >Once logged in, teachers can select their course type, either "Istituto Tecnico" or "Liceo Scienze Applicate" and navigate to a table page where they can add, update, and delete exam information. The application uses routing to allow for seamless navigation between pages and to ensure that only authorized users have access to the exam management features.

  - >The project is fully Dockerized, meaning that it is packaged within a Docker container for easy deployment and scaling. It also uses a Flask server to handle backend functionality. The server link is stored in a link.ts file, which is then imported and used throughout the application to communicate with the server and fetch or update data.

  - >This website allows teachers to have a centralized and easy-to-use platform to manage exams and schedules, and its Dockerization makes it easy to deploy and scale as needed.

THANK YOU!
